# Credit Scoring for Aave V2 Wallets

## üí° Problem Statement

This project addresses the problem of credit risk evaluation in the DeFi ecosystem, specifically for wallets interacting with the Aave V2 protocol. Given raw transaction-level data, our goal is to assign a **credit score between 0 and 1000** to each wallet based on their historical activity.

- **Score 0:** Extremely risky, bot-like or exploitative behavior.
- **Score 1000:** Very safe, reliable usage with responsible financial behavior.

## üìÇ Data Description

Each transaction record includes:
- `userWallet`: the wallet address
- `action`: one of `deposit`, `borrow`, `repay`, `redeemunderlying`, `liquidationcall`
- `actionData`: contains the `amount` involved
- Timestamps, block info, and other metadata

Dataset contains 100K+ records.

## üîß Feature Engineering

Wallet-level features extracted:

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `deposit_amount` | Total amount deposited |
| `borrow_amount` | Total amount borrowed |
| `repay_amount` | Total amount repaid |
| `repayment_ratio` | repay_amount / borrow_amount |
| `borrow_deposit_ratio` | borrow_amount / deposit_amount |
| `liquidations` | Number of times the wallet was liquidated |
| `active_days` | Distinct days the wallet interacted with protocol |
| `total_actions` | Total transactions by wallet (for normalization) |

---

##‚öôÔ∏è Scoring Logic

The score is calculated based on a weighted heuristic:

```python
score_raw = (
    0.3 * repayment_ratio +
    0.2 * (1 - borrow_deposit_ratio) +
    0.2 * active_days +
    0.3 * (1 - (liquidations / (total_actions + 1)))
)
### ML-Based Extension (Optional)

As an enhancement, I also experimented with training a `RandomForestRegressor` using the engineered wallet features. The target labels were the scores generated by the heuristic model.

This allowed us to:
- Evaluate model-learned scoring behavior
- Interpret feature importances
- Replace manual weights with data-driven predictions
